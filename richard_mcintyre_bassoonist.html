					<br>
						<p>Richard McIntyre, OAM, BMus (University of Sydney) has maintained a long and distinguished
							career as bassoonist, music educator, conductor and arranger. A Composition graduate from
							Sydney University, he was appointed Associate Principal Bassoon with the Sydney Symphony
							Orchestra as a 20-year-old in 1968, moving to The Canberra School of Music as a foundation
							member of the Canberra Wind Soloists in 1978. With this renowned quintet, he recorded and
							toured internationally during a 30-year period, and gave it a unique repertoire with his
							virtuoso arrangements of large-scale orchestral works. He was for many years Principal
							Bassoonist with the Australian Chamber Orchestra, and appeared on many occasions as guest
							Principal Bassoonist with most of the Symphony Australia Orchestras – also as concerto
							soloist, and independently as a recitalist.</p>
						<p>His continuing work as Principal Bassoon with the Canberra Symphony Orchestra dates back
							to student days of 1965 – 67. If you’d like to hear some of his work as bassoonist, chamber
							musician, and arranger, you’ll find it on YouTube under Canberra Wind Soloists.</p>
						<p>Simultaneously, he has sustained a career as one of Australia’s most respected bassoon
							teachers, at all levels from beginner to post-graduate and professional. In addition he has
							worked tirelessly in the development of orchestral and ensemble skills with students of all
							instruments, particularly at the advanced tertiary level. He was for many years a regular
							tutor and conductor at the Australian Youth Orchestra’s National Music Camps. He has taught
							over many years in south-east Asia.</p>
						<p>His work as a conductor is well-known, particularly in Canberra. He was Conductor and
							Musical Director of the Canberra Youth Orchestra from 1980 – 1990, greatly broadening
							its repertoire and general endeavour, and led it on three highly-successful and
							widely-acclaimed European tours. His Canberra contribution has included development of and
							much work with the School of Music Orchestra, Canberra Opera, Canberra Philharmonic
							Society, thirteen-years as Musical Director of The Llewellyn Choir (with development of its
							accompanying professional ensemble, The Canberra Chamber Orchestra), and three years as
							Musical Director of The Oriana Chorale.</p>
						<p>His numerous conducting activities outside of Canberra have included the foundation and
							development of the Barrier Reef Orchestra, with which he continues his association as
							Artistic Advisor and frequent conductor.</p>
						<p>His 35-year career at the Canberra (now ANU) School of Music played a significant part in
							the creation of its erstwhile international reputation. Awards have included 1986 Canberran
							of the Year, Advance Australia, Sounds Australian, and National Critics’ Circle awards. In
							1992 he was granted an Order of Australia Medal, for services to Music and Music Education,
							particularly for his work with the Canberra Youth Orchestra. In 2013, he was elected
							President of the Australian Double Reed Society.</p>a
