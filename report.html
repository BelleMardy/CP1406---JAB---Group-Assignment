<h2>Report Details</h2>
    
<ul>
	<li>GitHub link - <font size="4"><a href="https://github.com/BelleMardy/CP1406---JAB---Group-Assignment/"> http://github.com/</a></font></h2></li>
    <li>Work completed and details - The JAB Team completed a website for the Barrier Reef Orchrestra as outlined in Assignment 2. Testing was carried out using several people and it was found that the website functioned adequatley in the areas of learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors and satisfaction. There are no passwords or usernames required and there are no instructions as the site is intuitive. </li>
    <li>References - All code was created by JAB. All images and content were obtained from either the existing Barrier Reef Orchrestra website or JCU supplied information. The exception is the feeder page, where information was obtained from an <font size="4"><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2015/03/25/4204375.htm">ABC News Article</a></font></h2></li>
    <li>Pluses, minuses and intersting aspects - We worked well together as a team by having regular meetings, collaberation on ideas, concepts and taking on tasks to be completed. A negative aspect was competing priorities of other subjects which had assignments and exams due at the same time as this assignment. There were issues around the version control in GitHub. Lastly there was a significant amount of confusion by incorrect information being supplied or unavailable at given times. The most interesting aspect was the different thought processes, understanding of assignment requirements and successes in completing allocated tasks.</li>
