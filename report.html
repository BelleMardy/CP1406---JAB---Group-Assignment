		<p>Testing Details</p>
			<ul>
				<p>Testing was carried out using several people and it was
					found that the website functioned adequatley in the 
					areas of learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors
					and satisfaction. Task oriented tests were	also carried
					out such as buying tickets, becoming a member, emailing 
					people within the Barrier Reef	Orchestra (BRO), learning
					who the artist was for the next concert and joining the
					mailing list. Feedback given from testing resulted in 
					improvements being made to the website which made it more
					intuitive, while improving the asthetics and usability of site.</p>
				
				<p>There are potential issuse with the search function as we understand
					it needs to be a functioning website prior to operating correctly
					ie; doing a search within the website. Most of the pages on the 
					website are responsive, however there are still some unresolved
					issues in relation to a fully responsive website.</p>
				
				<p>References - All code was created by JAB. All images and content were 
					obtained from either the existing Barrier Reef Orchrestra website or 
					JCU supplied information. The exception is the feeder page, where 
					information was obtained from an
					<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2015/03/25/4204375.htm">
					ABC News Article.</a></p>

		<h2>
			<p>PMI</p>
				<ul>Pluses: We worked well together as a team by having regular meetings,
					collaberation on ideas, concepts and taking on tasks to be completed and 
					completing those tasks. We also supported other team members as required.
					<br>
					<br>
					Minuses: A negative aspect was competing priorities of other subjects which
					had assignments and exams due at the same time as this assignment. There
					were issues around the version control in GitHub. There was a significant
					amount of confusion by incorrect information being supplied or unavailable
					at given times.
					<br>
					<br>
					Interesting: The most interesting aspect was the different thought processes,
					understanding of assignment requirements and successes in completing allocated
					tasks. As a team we created a plan, however during the development and testing
					stages we realised that those plans needed to be adjusted to suit the desired 
					final outcome.
