<h2>By Patrick Hession and Kathleen Calderwood ABC News</h2> 
<ul><p>Leah Li is dwarfed by the harp she rests on her shoulder while she elegantly plucks its strings. The $34,000 instrument is the newest addition to the Barrier Reef Orchestra's repertoire, and Leah says it's a privilege each time she gets to play it.</p>
<p>"It is a beautiful harp," she said.</p>
<p>"It has a very very beautiful sound."</p>
<p>The harp weighs 30 kilograms and has 47 strings. Leah likens the strings to the white keys on a piano, while the pedals are the black keys. At home Leah practices on a much older harp, but she says it gets the job done.</p> 
<p>"I have [had] an old harp for about 15 years now, the sound is really good but mechanically you just need to tune up," she said.</p>
<p>"You actually need to tune the harp mechanically because there's so many different pins and so many pedals... [it's] a lot of work to maintain it."</p>
<p>Orchestra president Andrew Ryder says the harp is a great addition to the ensemble; previously they had to hire a harp and fly a harpist up especially for their performances. Luckily Leah had just moved to Townsville when the Orchestra purchased the harp.</p>
<p>"It's a wonderful instrument visually but of course the sound of the harp is just fantastic live," Andrew said. </p>
<p>"It's immediately identifiable and it adds so much to the orchestra.</p>
<p>"We wish it would come with a truck as well to move it around," he added.</p> 
<p>The Barrier Reef Orchestra's first performance for the year is on this Sunday, March 29 at the Townsville Civic Theatre, and will feature Leah on the harp and flute player Jennifer Bradstreet.</p></ul>
